# Sprint 1 Review

## Sprint Summary:
Sprint 1 focused on building the foundational functionality for Friendly Foodsâ€™ check-in system, specifically supporting new visitor registration and returning visitor check-ins. The goal was to enforce the 7-day visit restriction while ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

## Completed Work:

- Configured SQLExpress database and created users table
- Implemented API to store new user data with unique phone number constraint
- Developed check-in feature with last visit date logic
- Displayed appropriate messages based on eligibility to check in
- Logged check-ins with timestamp

## Demonstration:
The demo showcased the following functionality:
- A first-time visitor entering their name and phone number to register
- A successful check-in for a visitor who had not visited in 7+ days
- A returning visitor being shown a message stating how many days remain before they can return

## Feedback:
- Stakeholders were pleased with the simplicity and clarity of the check-in process.
- Requested future enhancements such as admin reporting tools and multi-language support.
