## What Went Well:
- **Clear Communication:** Daily standups were effective and helped keep everyone aligned.

- **Successful Delivery:** All work items were completed and passed acceptance criteria.
- **Stable Infrastructure:** SQLExpress worked reliably during both development and testing.

## What Could Be Improved:
- **Test Planning Timing:** QA and Test Engineers noted that writing test cases earlier in the sprint would help avoid last-minute fixes.
- **Design Wireframes:** Developers requested more detailed wireframes or UI mockups to speed up front-end implementation.
- **Database Setup:** Initial database schema design took longer than expected. We should create reusable scripts for future deployments.

## Action Items:
- Schedule QA involvement during sprint planning.
- Add a wireframing step to the sprint planning checklist.
- Create SQL schema scripts to automate environment setup.

## Team Morale:
- Overall morale was **high**, with team members reporting strong collaboration and a shared sense of ownership over the product.

## Final Notes:
Sprint 1 successfully laid the groundwork for Friendly Foods' check-in system. With the foundational functionality completed, the team is well-prepared to expand features in Sprint 2, including admin access, historical data viewing, and multi-language support.
